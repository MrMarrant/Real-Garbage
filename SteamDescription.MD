[h2]Feature[/h2]
Real garbage is an addon containing two ([i]pretty[/i]) garbage can entities.
Inside the garbage cans, you can store all sorts of different entities, props and even NPCs you'd like to silence.

You can, of course, remove their containers one by one, using the action button on the garbage can, which will remove the waste that was added last in order.

They each have a maximum capacity, as well as life statistics, so they can be destroyed, resulting in the expulsion of all trashs.

They are animated, with customized sounds for physics, damage received, or when adding/removing trash.

If you take good care of them, they'll return the favor [b]UwU[/b]

[h2]How to use it ?[/h2]
Well, simply take the entity to be disposed of, and place it in the garbage can as shown below.

To remove it from the garbage can, simply press the action key on it, and the garbage will appear next to the garbage can.
Caution: some garbage that's too big can 'noclip' into the ground.

If you destroy the garbage can, all the garbage will be released at once.

[h2]Config[/h2]

There's a convar that allows you to authorize or disallow NPCs to be throw in the garbage's, which you can change at any time from your server console.

It is enabled by default, but you can change it by typing : 
[quote]Enable_Throw_NPC_Trash 0[/quote]

Or, to activate it, simply enter : 
[quote]Enable_Throw_NPC_Trash 1[/quote]
