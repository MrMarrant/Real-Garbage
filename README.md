# Real Garbage

Real garbage is an addon containing two (_pretty_) garbage can entities.<br>
Inside the garbage cans, you can store all sorts of different entities, props and even NPCs you'd like to **silence**.

You can, of course, remove their containers one by one, using the action button on the garbage can, which will remove the waste that was added last in order.

They each have a maximum capacity, as well as life statistics, so they can be destroyed, resulting in the expulsion of all trashs.

They are animated, with customized sounds for physics, damage received, or when adding/removing trash.

If you take good care of them, they'll return the favor **UwU**
